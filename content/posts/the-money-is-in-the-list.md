  Building an email list is the single most important thing when starting on
  affiliate marketing

**The money is in the list** - you will see it everywhere when you learn about affiliate marketing and it is true.

Being able to email your subscribers with offers and follow-ups will make you far more sales than sending random users to your affiliate link. \
More than 99% of users will not buy your offers immediately and if they only clicked on your link, they are lost at that moment. \
\
But if you got them to sign up to your mailing list you can warm them up with follow-up emails introducing them to more details about your offer. You can also send them other offers, if the first one you send them are of no interest.

### So how do I build an email list

There are many tools you can use to build an email list. The best one in my opinion is GetResponse. It's more than just an email list builder. You will have an autoresponder that enables you to send emails automatically at specified days after users sign up. \
You can create awesome landing pages where you can tell users about your offer and get them to sign up to that important mailing list. \
You will get an automation tool that works like an autoresponder but you can set certain criteria to that users have to fulfill to get the email. The possibilities are almost endless.

The best part is that you will get a 30-day FREE trial.\
