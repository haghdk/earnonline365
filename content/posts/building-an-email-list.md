  When starting your affiliate marketing business you need traffic to your
  offers. There are many ways you can do this. The best method is to send you
  offers to your email list promoting the product you want to sell. 

  But maybe you have just started your own affiliate marketing business and you
  don’t have an email list you can promote your offers to.

**So how to build an email list?**

The first thing you will need to build an email list is an optin-page where people can signup. The are a wide range of different marketing tools you can do this with, like ClickFunnels, AWeber and GetResponse, to name a few.\
I would really recommend you to use GetResponse. In my opinion it is the best email list builder, landing page creator, autoresponder and automation tool - and much more.

With GetResponse you can grow your email list and create optin-pages where people can signup to receive newsletter, updates and affiliate offers.

You can choose to create a generic optin-page where you can have a give-away, for example an ebook in exchange for an email - people like free stuff - or you can create an optin-page for a specific offer you are promoting and in exchange for an email you will present the user the amazing offer.

You can signup for a 30-day FREE trial  **[\==> HERE](https://secure.getresponse.com/create_trial/?a=pEkMFNHHwP)** 

You can then start to build a mailing list for free



**Getting traffic to your page**

When you have created your optin-page, you need to drive traffic to that page

One really effective way is by using solo ads. Solo ads are email ads sent directly to highly targeted users that have agreed to receive emails with offers or updates on a specific niche that they are interested in, for example “Make money online”.

The best and most reliant service selling solo ads are Udimi. Here you can find solo ad sellers that people trust and are getting great results from. You can filter out sellers by reviews, sales etc. and finding the best sellers.

From one seller I got almost 30% signups!

One thing that makes Udimi trustworthy and secure is that your payment will be in escrow and only released in full to the seller when he/she has completed you order. So if the seller for example stops you order at 50% you will get a 50% refund.

You can go ahead and start your first order right **\==> [HERE](https://udimi.com/a/4wx8q)**
