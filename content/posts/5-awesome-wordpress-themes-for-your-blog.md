This makes the platform perfect for bloggers and beginners who just want a blog or a website quickly with no technical obstacles.

Wordpress offers thousands of ready-made designs, known as themes that can be installed with a just few clicks inside the Wordpress administration without any required coding knowledge. 

Many themes are made for blogs but there are also many themes that are made for photography websites, art websites, or portfolios. Themes can be found in many varieties and some are free and some are premium versions. 

While a free version can be enough for many bloggers, the premium versions offer more functionality and I do recommend investing some money in a good theme if you are serious about your blog or website.

In this list, you will find five awesome premium Wordpress themes for your own blog, that will hopefully help you along to way to get started with your Wordpress site.
