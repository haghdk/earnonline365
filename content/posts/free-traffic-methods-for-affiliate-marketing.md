As you may already know there are two main traffic methods to get customers to your affiliate offers. Paid traffic and free traffic. Paid traffic is a great option if you want to get visitors fast, but it can also be really expensive really fast without any guarantee that the customers will buy your offer.

Free traffic on the other hand, though much slower than paid, is a great way to get visitors without risking your entire budget.

In this article I will give you some tips on how you can get free traffic to your affiliate offers.

## What is affiliate affiliate marketing?

In case you still wonder what affiliate marketing is and how it works, here is a short introduction. When you do affiliate marketing you promote one or more products - mostly or entirely online - in a specific niche, for example health or home improvement. By sending real customers to these offers, some of them might end up buying the product, which will earn you a commission. The commission varies based on the affiliate network, the product, etc. On ClickBank for example you could earn as much as 90% - or even 100% - in commission, on a product that is 100% online based. On the other hand, Amazon Associates pays only up to 10% on products that are physical.

## Why free traffic is a great way to get sales.

Promoting your affiliate offer on a website store, a blog, or a YouTube channel will not get any sales without any visitors. Your success will not be anything to tell anyone about. Fortunately there is free traffic. \
With the free traffic method you drive visitors to your offers or website without spending money on advertising, solo ads or any other paid traffic option, and the traffic will continue to come in, opposed to an advertising campaign that will end when it reaches the budget limit.

There are many ways to generate free traffic and they are not as difficult as you might think.

And the best part of it all is that, once you get it going, you will be able to drive traffic to your affiliate offer 24 hours are day, every day of the year.

## Free traffic sources.

Driving traffic to your affiliate offers can come from multiple free sources all with different audiences and different states of buying readiness.

Using several traffic sources should get you a wide range of these visitors and earn you some affiliate commissions.

### Start a Blog

Creating your own blog - like this one - is one of the best ways to get free traffic. On your blog you can post content reviewing your offers, promoting tools with affiliate programs etc.

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is a huge part of this method. SEO it the process of optimizing your website to make it indexed on search engines on the first page and on the top results. This can be scary at first but fear not. You don’t have to be an expert to search engine optimize your website. A little bit of research and YouTube videos will get you a long way.

It takes some time and optimization to see results. But the results can be really rewarding. A good rule of thumb is that it takes about 15-20 blog posts at about 1700-2000 words to see some great results.

### YouTube

This is also a really great way to drive traffic to your affiliate offers. You can create videos on your own channel where you review the products you are promoting. This could ensure trust among your viewers and some of them might end up buying the product. For some people though, being on camera or microphone might not be preferable, but there are other ways. You can you use a tool like Content Samurai to create stunning videos without yourself speaking. You can also try to find someone on Fiverr that could create a video for you.

### Facebook

Facebook is the second-ranked website in the world next to Google. This is a great platform to promote your affiliate offers buy creating a fan page or group.

### Instagram

By using the largest social image sharing platform in the world you can get you some good quality free traffic to your affiliate offers. Start by creating a profile and posting images that depicts something about your niche and you will start to build a list of followers. Use the bio to place your affiliate link.

### Reddit

Being the leading social news and discussion platform in the world, Reddit can be a great source of free traffic. Posting your affiliate link with review about the offer could lead to sales and commissions.

### Pinterest

As an image-based social media network, Pinterest is also a great platform to promote your affiliate offers. By creating your own board based on your selected niche, you can easily promote your offers.

### Forums

Posting in a forum based around your selected niche can also be a great way to get real customers sent to your affiliate offers. Start by posting good quality answers to questions being asked and after a couple of posts you can start posting your affiliate links.

### Build an email list

The importance of building a large email list for your affiliate marketing business can never be underestimated. Being able to send offers to a large group of interested people can earn you big commission. You can use some or all of the methods mentioned above to build your email list.

## Free traffic pros & cons

As with anything else free traffic also have some pros & cons you will have to consider when taking this approach to promote your affiliate offers.

**PROS**

* **It’s free**\
  You don’t need any budget to get started. A note to be made is that you need to be aware that if you do not own a website or a domain, you will need to spend money on that.
* **It’s continuous traffic**\
  As this method doesn’t have any budget or time limit, once setup and optimized the traffic will keep coming in to your offers.
* **Multiple options**\
  This method have multiple free options and platforms to use to drive traffic.

**CONS**

* **Time consuming**\
  Unless you are a leading SEO expert, it will take some will take some time before you will see any results.
* **Multiple options**\
  This is both a pro and a con. For a beginner, it can be quite difficult to figure out which options to begin with.
* **It needs work**\
  It does take some work to begin. You need to research how SEO works. You need to setup a blog and write good content. You need to create meaningful videos for your YouTube channel, etc.

## Safe lists are to avoid

When you start your own research on the different free traffic methods, you will probably at some point find something about “safe lists” which I would recommend you NOT to use. Safe lists are sometimes compared to solo ads, but there are huge differences. With solo ads emails with your affiliate offer are send to interested people that have signed up to receive email about your specific niche for example “health & fitness”. Safe lists are really large email lists that people sign up to, to be able to send email campaigns to that email list. So people that receive your affiliate offer in their inbox probably won’t even open it. Therefore the conversion rate with safe lists are really bad. Try to avoid them.

## Final words

Free traffic is one of the best ways to earn commissions as an affiliate marketeer. But you will need a good amount of patience as is can take some time before you will start to see any results, but the rewards that will come in the end is all worth the effort.
