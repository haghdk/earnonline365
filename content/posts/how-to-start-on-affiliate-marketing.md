The passive income you eventually can stack up from affiliate marketing is without a doubt very alluring.

Although the concept of affiliate marketing is very simple - you promote a product, and gets a commission when you make a sale, it can be a bit confusing to know where to start.

It was for me, but after some trying around and a bit of research I started to figure it out.

## So how do you start on affiliate marketing?

\
\
**1. Find a niche**

A “nitch” or “neesh”? It is said both ways :-)

Whatever way you pronounce it, choosing one will get you started on your online business, and make it easier to create campaigns and focus your targeted marketing.

It can be quite difficult to choose a niche to begin with, but a good start would be to choose a niche that you are passionate about. That will make it easier to create campaigns and target the right people, when you have knowledge about that niche.

But you must make sure that there are money in the niche you have chosen. That there are other people interested in the products you are promoting.

That being said, the three recommended niches are “Money”, “Health” and “Relationships”.

People wants to have money, a good health and a great love life. :-)

**2. Select an affiliate network**

When you have chosen a niche in which you want to promote products, you can now select an affiliate network. The are plenty to choose from, but I would recommend to start with ClickBank - URL

It is the largest and most trusted affiliate network, having been in business for two decades. And you could potentially earn commissions of up to a 100%. Yes one hundred percent!

Check out the marketplace by clicking on “Affiliate Marketplace” at the top, and check to different categories and which products they contain.

To join ClickBank just click “Create Account” and fill out your information.

After you have joined you can then select a product in the marketplace that you want to promote.

A good rule of thumb is to look at the gravity score. It is number that shows how many distinct affiliates that have earned a commission during the past 12 weeks promoting that particular product. The higher the number the more affiliates. This number is not automatically a criteria for success. A really high number also means high competition. So try to find a gravity score between 20 and 100.

Click on the red “Promote” button and in the new window type in your account nickname and click “Generate Hoplinks” to get your unique link to promote. You can also type in a name in the Tracking ID field to be able to track the different traffic sources you are using, for example if you are promoting on Facebook, you can type that in.

**3. Building an email list**

When you have chosen a product you wants to promote and you have create a unique link, you will want someone to see that product. This is where the most important part in your online business comes in. Many new affiliate marketers makes the huge mistake and just throw their link all around the internet. This is a bad idea because most people will not buy the first time they see some random product from a link they just clicked. They need to be warmed up by getting more details and recommendations about the product.

This is where the email list comes in. When you get a user to signup to your email list you can send the user a line of different emails promoting the same product with a different tellings in each emails. And you can also at a later point in time promote other products in the same niche.

**So how do I get someone to signup?**

You do that by creating a simple opt-in page where you can write a little about the product in a few lines to wake the user’s curiosity. You can promise then access to details in exchange for the email and more effective a free gift like an ebook. After signup you can send them directly to the product salespage or you can show a thank you page and show them the product later on in your email sequence.

Use a marketing tool where you can create an autoresponder or use automation the build a sequence of mails where you promote the product. The tool I am using is GetResponse. With that you can create email lists, landingpages, set up autoresponders or automation etc. You can sign up for FREE 30-day trial **[HERE](https://www.getresponse.com/?a=pEkMFNHHwP)**

**4. Traffic**

There are two types of traffic, organic (free) and paid. There are many different ways you can get free traffic.

You can create a Facebook post, you can promote your landingpage on Instagram. You can also create a YouTube video promoting and recommending the product. These are some of the best ways the get free traffic and in the end SALES.

You can also create your own blog - like this one - and write reviews about the products. Reviews are a great way to get sales as people trust a good review. The fastest way to get started selecting a host with a one-click installation of Wordpress. Bluehost is one of the best.

Finding a forum in the category as the product is also a great way to get traffic. Don’t just spam the forum with your links. Start by giving useful answers to questions and then eventually recommend the product that could solve the problem being asked about.

Paid traffic is also a great source get sales. The most effective types are Google Ads or Microsoft Ads. A thing to be noted here is that Google will not accept affiliate links so here you will need an opt-in page. Microsoft on the other hand accepts affiliate links. This blog post will though be way to long to have a step-by-step guide on how to set up campaigns in Google Ads and Microsoft Ads. :-) But there are many great videos on YouTube explaining it in detail.

Udimi is a quick way to get signups to you email list. On Udimi people with 1000s of ready-to-buy subscribers are selling solo ads where they will send your link to x number of subscribers which then could sign up to your email list. I get about 20-25% signups on Udimi which is GREAT.

**5. Tracking**

Being able to track your results is key to success. You would want to see how many people clicking on your link to get an idea of the effectiveness of your campaign.

The best way to track this is by using a link tracker. The best one is **[ClickMagick](https://www.clickmagick.com/)**.

**6. Training**

Signing up for an affiliate training program is a really good idea to get started. That way you can avoid making many of basic mistake many new affiliate marketers (including me) are making. It is money really great spend. Many experience marketers have training programs, but the one I will recommend is the 12 Minute Affiliates program that have all the basic information to get a succesful start in affiliate marketing. You can see more about the program and get started **[HERE](https://f8aa9ajej9czdobbkqmc3p4ua8.hop.clickbank.net/?tid=MAKEMONEYONLINENINJA)**.

I hope these basic steps can help you get started. Besides these steps just watch a bunch of YouTube videos on the matter. It can be a tremendous help to watch how other affiliate marketers work.
