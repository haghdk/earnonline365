That’s a bad idea for many reasons. One of them is that you would lose a lot of potential future buyers because you have no chance to promote the offer to them again at a later point when they might be more willing to buy. This is why you always use a landing page to get people to signup to your email list before sending them to your affiliate offer. Another one, and at least equal, if not more, important, is that you have you no idea what’s working and what’s not and therefore have no knowledge of where to optimize your campaign to get more leads and sales.

That’s where link tracking comes into play. With the correct link tracking setup, you will be able to see how your different affiliate campaigns are performing and adjust and optimize those that aren’t performing well and you should be able to see an increase in leads and sales.

## What is link tracking?

Link tracking is the tracking of clicks you will get on links on a various channels such as a website, a Facebook posts, a banner or an email. In affiliate affiliate marketing this type of tracking is especially useful when you run multiple campaigns. That way you will be able to track your campaigns and through reporting find out which campaigns work and which need adjustments and optimization. Link tracking can vary from a simple counting of clicks to in-depth analysis of conversion rates and CPC. This is information is particularly useful when calculating a return on investment.

## Why link tracking is important

With the proper link tracking you will have all the data you need to analyze how all of your affiliate marketing campaigns are performing. That way you can easily identify those that are performing badly and optimizing them to increase their performance and get higher conversion rates.
