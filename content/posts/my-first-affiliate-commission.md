  When you see that affiliate sales commission for the first time it makes it
  all worth it. All the YouTube videos you have watched, all the blog posts you
  have read. All the time invested to get started with affiliate marketing. All
  the training. It makes it all worth it.

## My start on affiliate marketing

I just started with affiliate marketing a couple of months ago but I have wanted to get into it in a couple of years, but I did not have the motivation and time to get started. Until a couple of months ago when I coincidentally stumbled upon a couple of videos on YouTube about affiliate marketing - you got to love the YouTube algorithm :-D

Those training videos explained it in ways I haven’t realized before and presented tools I wasn’t aware of. And it explained the affiliate network Clickbank that I neither were aware of.

Suddenly, I got that motivation that I was so much missing and I jumped straight into it affiliate marketing.

**That’s where I did it wrong.**

I just found some products that I wanted to promote, signed up to GetResponse, created an email list, created a squeeze page, bought some traffic and then - no sales. I did get some signups but they didn’t convert into sales. Most of them didn’t even open the emails. So obviously I thought I did something wrong. So I found a new product, made a new squeeze page, bought new traffic and got the same results. That way I wasted about $200. Not the perfect way to start with affiliate marketing :-)

That’s where I learned that affiliate marketing takes patience - and it also takes some hard work. It is definitely not a get-rich-quick method.

I went back you watch more YouTube videos and read more blog posts. I saw a video that Devon Brown, the internet entrepreneur behind The 12 Minute Affiliate System, had created, and in that video, he explained quite well how to keep promoting the same product in multiple email swipes, be patient and accept the fact that people will buy a product when they need it and when they got the time to look at it. Not when you expect them to. Not exactly in those terms, but that’s what I got from that video.

That made me rethink my whole approach on how I started with affiliate marketing and I then made tweaks and changes to my email list swipes and my squeeze pages - and I got more patient :-)

After I while I started to get new signups and I got a better email open rate and they clicked on the links in the mails.

I also made some sales that got me that long awaited commission. To see that commission is what affiliate marketing is all about :-)

By writing this blog post I hope that I can help you that want to get into affiliate marketing to avoid the same mistakes I did. Not to avoid mistakes. Mistakes are what we all learn from. But I hope I can help you to not wasting money and motivation and instead get a successful start on affiliate marketing.

Start on training

One on the best ways to get started is to use training where you will learn all the basics and learn how to avoid the common mistakes. One of the best training modules is the 12 Minute Affiliate System which I would really recommend you to start with.

Building an email list

As I explained in [THIS](https://www.makemoneyonlineninja.com/building-an-email-list/) post, building an email list is really important. I am using GetResponse as my list builder and autoresponder. You can sign up for a 30-day FREE trial [HERE](https://www.getresponse.com/?a=pEkMFNHHwP&c=makemoneyonlineninja).
